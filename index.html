  <div class="intro">    
  <p>In 2017, Cher is still more relevant than ever. She's the only artist to have a No. 1 single on the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7800161/cher-music-radical-icon" class="yellow-link">Billboard </a>charts each of the last six decades and, as such, she received the Icon Award at this year's Billboard Music Awards. The touchstone of her career has always been her ability to not only adapt to the times, but to be one step ahead of them.</p> 
        <p>From late-night television to the big screen, pop radio to dance halls, from the Las Vegas strip to — come 2018 — Broadway, Cher has done it all.</p>

      <p>The international star known as Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian on May 20, 1946, in El Centro, California. She was raised by her mother Georgia, a model and actress, and grew up in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County with younger half-sister Georganne.</p>
      <p>Cher had been placed in an orphanage at one point while her mother looked for work. Even though the family struggled financially,  she knew from a young age that the world of arts and entertainment spoke to her.</p>
      <p> At age 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved into Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small clubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip and introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents.</p>
